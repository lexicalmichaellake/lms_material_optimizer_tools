Many of our students find hunting for information in a textbook on a screen more challenging sometimes. That is why I ran some tests and found that, in the vText for the Vista Higher Learning textbook Aventuras 5th edition, it is possible to create hyperlinked study guides that bring your students straight to a given page.

This JavaScript tool facilitates that process.  Instructions for using it appear on the page.

Good luck this semester!
